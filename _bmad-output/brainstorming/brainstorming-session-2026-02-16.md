# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Wouter
**Date:** 2026-02-16

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Midjourney prompts for Perch's full visual identity -- logo, tagline, marketing site imagery, profile/social images

**Goals:** A cohesive set of Midjourney prompts across multiple visual directions. Generate, compare, then converge on a winner.

### Session Setup

- **Audience:** Broad -- developers, gamers, power users, casual users (WPF app makes Perch accessible beyond CLI)
- **Brand Anchors:** "Perch" (bird metaphor), forest green (#10B981), symlink-first dotfiles manager, nature-organic vibe, dark UI
- **Color Scheme:** Forest green (#10B981) with dark background (#1a1a2e), hover #059669, pressed #047857
- **Approach:** Explore 3-4 distinct visual angles, each producing a coherent prompt set (logo + tagline + marketing + profiles), then compare and choose

## Technique Execution Results

### Phase 1: Metaphor Mapping

Four metaphorical layers of "Perch" identified and developed into visual directions:

1. **"Canopy"** -- The Bird's Perch: branch, resting place, vantage point, organic forest world
2. **"Current"** -- The Freshwater Perch: underwater clarity, flow, transparency, data streams
3. **"Lookout"** -- The Vantage Point: elevated calm authority, oversight, explorer aesthetic
4. **"Click"** -- The Act of Landing: satisfying connection, precision meeting organic form

### Phase 2: Cross-Pollination

Style references mapped per direction:

- **Canopy:** Studio Ghibli environmental art + MTG forest land art + Firewatch aesthetic. Painterly concept art.
- **Current:** BBC Blue Planet cinematography + Houdini/Blender fluid sims + aquascape design. Lush 3D render.
- **Lookout:** Fantasy cartography + Breath of the Wild vistas + aviation/explorer illustration. Painterly concept art.
- **Click:** Mechanical/patent illustration + biomechanical art (warm) + ASMR satisfying-fit. Painterly concept art.

### Key Decisions

- **Bird:** Stylized fantasy bird (not realistic species, not geometric)
- **Poses:** Both perched (calm authority) and mid-landing (dynamic arrival) for logo marks
- **Style:** Painterly concept art for Canopy, Lookout, Click. Lush 3D render for Current.

### Phase 3: Morphological Analysis -- Prompt Library
